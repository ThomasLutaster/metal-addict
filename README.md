## Introduction

This project initially developped, one year ago, by a five developpers team as part of a training project:
* three developers for the api in back end.
* two developpers for the front end with React.

At this time, I worked in the front end team.

I've now decided to totally recode the Api part alone using Symfony framework and PHP 8 to use some of his new features (like new ay to use implements contructor , attributes...);

## Project concept

This repository is the APi part.
The repository of the font end part can be seen at his adress : 

## To come

* Full documentation of the API
* Adding a back-office for admin users with the template engine TWIG
