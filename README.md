# Metal-addict

## Introduction

This project was initially developed by a team composed of five developers including me, as part of a training project:

At the beginning, I worked on the front-end part of the project.

Now, I'm fully recoding **the back-end Api part** on my own. In order to do so, I used Symfony framework and PHP 8 new features.

## Project concept

This repository is the Api part of a website dedicated to Heavy Metal fans. The goal of this website is to reference all the existing concerts. Every users can create their own library of concerts, add some pictures, reviews... _All details about available features will come soon._

The repository of the front-end part can be seen here: https://github.com/ThomasLutaster/metal-addict-front

## New features to come

* Full API documentation.
* Add a back-office for admin users using the template engine TWIG.
* And more to come...
